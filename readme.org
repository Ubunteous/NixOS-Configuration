#+title: NixOS configuration

Welcome to my humble configuration.

A few highlights:
+ Modular configuration with flakes and home manager support
+ Multiple Windows Managers available (pick one in main-host.nix) including XMonad, LeftWM and QTile or hyprland and sway for Wayland. Cinnamon is also available if you prefer a more standard Desktop Environment
+ Custom Colemak layout which leaves Azerty special characters in place

The configuration is loaded in the following order: flake.nix > hosts/main-host.nix > everything else
